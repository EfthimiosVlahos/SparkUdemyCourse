# Mastering Big Data with Apache Spark and PySpark

This repository documents my journey and key takeaways from a comprehensive course focused on big data analysis using Apache Spark and PySpark. The course equipped me with the skills to leverage Spark for processing massive datasets efficiently.

## Skills Acquired

- **Spark and PySpark Basics**: Learned the core concepts of Spark's DataFrames and RDDs for robust data analysis.
- **Data Analysis Techniques**: Mastered framing complex data analysis problems as Spark problems and solving them through hands-on examples.
- **Machine Learning with Spark**: Utilized Spark's MLLib library for answering data mining questions and implementing machine learning models.
- **Real-time Data Processing**: Gained insight into processing continuous streams of data in real time with Spark Streaming.
- **Cloud Integration and Scalability**: Learned to scale data analysis projects using Amazon's Elastic MapReduce and Hadoop YARN.
- **Advanced Spark Features**: Explored Spark SQL for structured data analysis, GraphX for network analysis, and additional Spark-based technologies.

## Projects and Applications

- Analyzed a dataset of movie ratings to discover similar movies.
- Explored a social graph of superheroes to identify the most "popular" ones and calculated "degrees of separation" between them.

## Technologies Explored

- Apache Spark
- PySpark
- Amazon Elastic MapReduce
- Hadoop YARN
- Spark SQL, Spark Streaming, and GraphX

This course not only sharpened my technical skills in big data analysis but also provided practical experience with real-world datasets, preparing me for future challenges in the field of data science and machine learning.
